{"id":"ob-6ih","title":"Add Xcode build support to Orbital","description":"Extend Orbital to delegate Xcode builds from Linux containers to the macOS host, mirroring the existing Gradle delegation pattern. Xcode is macOS-only so this is the only path for iOS builds from containers.\n\nKey work:\n- Add 'xcode' build type to server with scheme/destination validation\n- Add 'orbital xcode \u003cproject\u003e \u003cscheme\u003e [--destination ...]' client subcommand\n- Artifact collection for .app, .ipa, .xcarchive, .dSYM\n- Allowlist pod install / swift package resolve as pre-build commands\n- Map signing_profile to Xcode provisioning profiles / code signing identities\n- Xcode-specific security checks (build settings injection prevention)\n\nThe core protocol (HTTP + SSE streaming, workspace rsync, artifact management) is already build-system agnostic.\n\nMigrated from: claude-dev-dwl","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"michael@dopple.com","created_at":"2026-02-21T15:13:08Z","created_by":"michaelatdopple","updated_at":"2026-02-21T15:13:08Z"}

Relative paths escaping the project tree (e.g. ../../../love/crew/lovelace for LOVE_DIR) resolve to nothing on the host.
